# Student-Data-Processor
This project is a Python script that analyzes student performance based on their grades and attendance. It reads data from a Google Sheets spreadsheet using the Google Sheets API, calculates each student's situation (e.g., "Aprovado", "Reprovado por Falta", "Exame Final"), and updates the spreadsheet with the results. The link to the spreadsheet I'm using is https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KG5wQeOpDFrC-2vDh2gMFKh_pulMeukgVxN7XktKAdA/edit?usp=sharing What I do here is to read 'Faltas', 'P1', 'P2' and 'P3' columns and write in 'Situação' e 'Nota para Aprovação Final' based on what was read.
